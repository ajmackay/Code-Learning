# TOP LEVEL HEADING

```{r, echo = FALSE, output = 'asis', include = FALSE }
# The top level heading can be static by using the # TOP LEVEL HEADING above.
# If a dynamic title is required (e.g., to include a report period date in the title), swap in below and make this chunk be included

str_c("# DYNAMIC TITLE CONTENT") %>% cat()
```

## Second Level Content Heading

The top level content headings get their own tabs. The next 2 heading levels get an entry in the ToC.

# Another Top Level

## Second top level stuff
